## Rate Based ACL

The module is creating resources for rate-base rule ACLs.
A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action on IPs with rates that go over a limit.
More information can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-rate-based.html)


## Usage

### Rate Based ACL

In general, two scenarios have been addressed:
1. WAF is associated with a resource behind a proxy and the client address must be taken from the x-forwarded-for header.
2. WAF is associated with a resource used directly by clients.
WAF can be associated with folowing resources:
Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AWS AppSync GraphQL API, or an Amazon Cognito user pool 

The example is describing the both use cases, usually you will need only one.

```terraform
module "rate_based_acl" {
  source = "../wafv2/rate-based-acl"

  aws_managed_resource_arns = [module.main.external_lb_arn, module.main.products2_lb_arn]
  environment               = local.ENVIRONMENT

  # global rule settings for x-forwarded-for,
  # paths_x-forwarded-for variable has not been set so it will work for all paths
  enable_x-forwarded-for_rule = true
  rate_based_limit_x-forwarded-for = 200
  paths_x-forwarded-for = ["/shop/api/v2/cart/phone/add", "/shop/api/v2/cart/phone/addaaaa"]

  # global rule settings for client IP
  # paths_client-ip will generate scope-down statements which will narrow down to the defined paths
  enable_client-ip_rule = true
  rate_based_limit_client-ip = 200
  paths_client-ip = ["/shop/api/v2/cart/phone/add", "/shop/api/v2/cart/phone/addaaaa"]


  tags = merge(
    {
      terraform   = "True"
      environment = local.ENVIRONMENT
      purpose     = "AWS rate-based ACL"
    }
  )
}
```

### Rate Based ACL with Custom Rule Group
This rule group is intended to be used with rate based acl to allow fine grained configuration.
The `config` variable allows to configure limit per paths.
The `aggregate_key_type` is indicating if the IP address should be taken either from the x-forwarded-for header (`FORWARDED_IP`) or from source IP (`IP`).

```terraform

module "rate-based-acl-with-custom-rule-group" {
  source = "../wafv2/rate-based-acl"

  aws_managed_resource_arns = [module.main.external_lb_arn, module.main.products2_lb_arn]
  environment               = local.ENVIRONMENT

  #global rule settings for x-forwarded-for
  enable_x-forwarded-for_rule = true
  rate_based_limit_x-forwarded-for = 200
  paths_x-forwarded-for = ["/shop/api/v2/cart/phone/add", "/shop/api/v2/cart/phone/abcd"]
  
  config = [
    {
      rule_name = "test-api"
      paths = ["/aaa/bbb/ccc", "test-1"]
      action = "block"
      limit = 300
      aggregate_key_type = "FORWARDED_IP" // (FORWARDED_IP | IP)
      text_transformations = ["NONE"]
    }
  ]
  
  tags = merge(
    {
      terraform   = "True"
      environment = local.ENVIRONMENT
      purpose     = "AWS rate-based ACL"
    }
  )
}

```

### Rate Based ACL with Custom Rule Group And Alerts
This rule group is intended to be used with rate based acl to allow fine grained configuration.
The `config` variable allows to configure limit per paths.
The `aggregate_key_type` is indicating if the IP address should be taken either from the x-forwarded-for header (`FORWARDED_IP`) or from source IP (`IP`).
